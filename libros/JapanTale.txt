              'A TALE OF OLD JAPAN' is reprinted from
              the 'Collected Poems' by Alfred Noyes (Vol.
              II., p. 308), where it is entitled "The Two
                Painters: A Tale of Old Japan."




                             _DEDICATION._


_THE appearance of this poem in its present form is due chiefly to the
demand created for it by a vanished hand. It was set to music as a
cantata by Coleridge Taylor, some years ago. He thought it his best
work. Hardly a week has passed since then without some performance of
it, in some part of the world; and it may be said that the music he
wrote for it has won the lasting affection of the thousands that have
heard it. He was, in two works, the most vital and spontaneous musician
of his time. The first was his youthful setting of Longfellow's
'Hiawatha.' Then came many years of experiment with European subjects,
disappointment, and apparent failure. In the Eastern theme of 'A Tale of
Old Japan' he found something which (as those who know his history will
understand) enabled him to draw the bow across his own heart-strings,
and, from the first note to the last, he gave in it the most pathetic,
the most haunting expression, to his own spirit. To me it was a most
moving fact that his great genius should have shown so scrupulous and
infinitely painstaking a regard for the words of the poem. He submitted
to their "narrow room," but in a way that suggests quite new
possibilities in the wedding of music and verse. He preserved every
cadence of every line, and yet he gave the freedom of music to the
whole, in a way that poets had ceased to think possible. It is therefore
to his memory that I would dedicate the poem, all too poor a chrysalis
as it must seem for those exquisite wings._




                          A TALE OF OLD JAPAN


Yoichi Tenko, the painter,             [Sidenote: I]
  Dwelt by the purple sea,
Painting the peacock islands
  Under his willow-tree:
Also in temples he painted
  Dragons of old Japan,
With a child to look at the pictures--
  Little O Kimi San.

Kimi, the child of his brother,
  Bright as the moon in May.
White as a lotus lily,
  Pink as a plum-tree spray,
Linking her soft arm round him
  Sang to his heart for an hour,
Kissed him with ripples of laughter
  And lips of the cherry flower.

Child of the old pearl-fisher
  Lost in his junk at sea,
Kimi was loved of Tenko
  As his own child might be,
Yoichi Tenko the painter,
  Wrinkled and grey and old,
Teacher of many disciples
  That paid for his dreams with gold.


Peonies, peonies crowned the May!     [Sidenote: II]
Clad in blue and white array
  Came Sawara to the school
Under the silvery willow-tree,
  All to learn of Tenko!
Riding on a milk-white mule,
  Young and poor and proud was he,
Lissom as a cherry spray
[Peonies, peonies crowned the day!]
And he rode the golden way
  To the school of Tenko.

                             [Illustration]

Swift to learn, beneath his hand
Soon he watched his wonderland
  Growing cloud by magic cloud,
Under the silvery willow-tree
  In the school of Tenko:
Kimi watched him, young and proud,
  Painting by the purple sea.
Lying on the golden sand
Watched his golden wings expand!
[None but Love will understand
  All she hid from Tenko.]

He could paint her tree and flower
Sea and spray and wizard's tower,
  With one stroke, now hard, now soft,
Under the silvery willow-tree
  In the school of Tenko:

He could fling a bird aloft,
  Splash a dragon in the sea,
Crown a princess in her bower,
With one stroke of magic power;
And she watched him hour by hour,
  In the school of Tenko.

Yoichi Tenko, wondering, scanned
All the work of that young hand,
  Gazed his kakemonos o'er
Under the silvery willow-tree
  In the school of Tenko:
"I can teach you nothing more,
  Thought, or craft, or mystery;
Let your golden wings expand,
They will shadow half the land,
All the world's at your command,
Come no more to Tenko."

Lying on the golden sand,
Kimi watched his wings expand:
Wept.--He could not understand
  Why she wept, said Tenko.


So, in her blue kimono,              [Sidenote: III]
  Pale as the sickle moon
Glimmered thro' soft plum-branches
  Blue in the dusk of June,
Stole she, willing and waning,
  Frightened and unafraid,--
"Take me with you, Sawara,
  Over the sea", she said.

Small and sadly beseeching,
  Under the willow-tree,
Glimmered her face like a foam-flake
  Drifting over the sea:
Pale as a drifting blossom,
  Lifted her face to his eyes:
Slowly he gathered and held her
  Under the drifting skies.

                             [Illustration]

Poor little face cast backward
  Better to see his own,
Earth and heaven went past them
  Drifting: they too, alone
Stood, immortal. He whispered--
  "Nothing can part us two!"
Backward her sad little face went
  Drifting, and dreamed it true.

"Others are happy," she murmured,
  "Maidens and men I have seen;
You are my king, Sawara,
  O, let me be your queen!
If I am all too lowly,"
  Sadly she strove to smile,
"Let me follow your footsteps,
  Your slave for a little while."

Surely, he thought, I have painted
  Nothing so fair as this
Moonlit almond blossom
  Sweet to fold and kiss,
Brow that is filled with music,
  Shell of a faery sea,
Eyes like the holy violets
  Brimmed with dew for me.

"Wait for Sawara" he whispered,
  Does not his whole heart yearn
Now to his moon-bright maiden?
  Wait, for he will return
Rich as the wave on the moon's path
  Rushing to claim his bride!"
So they plighted their promise,
  And the ebbing sea-wave sighed.


Moon and flower and butterfly,        [Sidenote: IV]
Earth and heaven went drifting by,
  Three long years while Kimi dreamed
Under the silvery willow-tree
  In the school of Tenko,
Steadfast while the whole world streamed
  Past her tow'rds Eternity;
Steadfast till with one great cry,
  Ringing to the gods on high,
Golden wings should bind the sky
  And bring him back to Tenko.

Three long years and nought to say
"Sweet, I come the golden way,
  Riding royally to the school
Under the silvery willow-tree
  Claim my bride of Tenko;
Silver bells on a milk-white mule,
  Rose-red sails on an emerald sea!"
Kimi sometimes went to pray
In the temple nigh the bay,
Dreamed all night and gazed all day
  Over the sea from Tenko.

Far away his growing fame
Lit the clouds. No message came
  From the sky, whereon she gazed
Under the silvery willow-tree
  Far away from Tenko!
Small white hands in the temple raised
  Pleaded with the Mystery--
"Stick of incense in the flame,
Though my love forget my name,
Help him, bless him, all the same,
  And ... bring him back to Tenko!"

_Rose-white temple nigh the bay,
Hush! for Kimi comes to pray,
Dream all night and gaze all day
  Over the sea from Tenko._

                             [Illustration]

                             [Illustration]

So, when the rich young merchant       [Sidenote: V]
  Showed him his bags of gold,
Yoichi Tenko, the painter,
  Gave him her hand to hold,
Said, "You shall wed him, O Kimi":
  Softly he lied and smiled--
"_Yea, for Sawara is wedded!
Let him not mock you, child._"

Dumbly she turned and left them,
  Never a word or cry
Broke from her lips' grey petals
  Under the drifting sky:
Down to the spray and the rainbows,
  Where she had watched him of old
Painting the rose-red islands,
  Painting the sand's wet gold.

                             [Illustration]

Down to their dreams of sunset,
  Frail as a flower's white ghost,
Lonely and lost she wandered
  Down to the darkening coast;
Lost in the drifting midnight,
  Weeping, desolate, blind
Many went out to seek her:
  Never a heart could find.

Yoichi Tenko, the painter
  Plucked from his willow-tree
Two big paper lanterns
  And ran to the brink of the sea;
Over his head he held them,
  Crying, and only heard
Somewhere out in the darkness,
  The cry of a wandering bird.

Peonies, peonies thronged the May     [Sidenote: VI]
When in royal-rich array
  Came Sawara to the school
Under the silvery willow-tree--
  To the school of Tenko!
Silver bells on a milk-white mule,
  Rose-red sails on an emerald sea!
Over the bloom of the cherry spray,
Peonies, peonies dimmed the day;
And he rode the royal way
  Back to Yoichi Tenko.

Yoichi Tenko, half afraid
Whispered, "Wed some other maid;
  Kimi left me all alone
Under the silvery willow-tree,
  Left me," whispered Tenko,
"Kimi had a heart of stone!"--
  "Kimi, Kimi? Who is she?
Kimi? Ah, the child that played
Round the willow-tree. She prayed
Often; and, whate'er I said,
  She believed it, Tenko."

He had come to paint anew
Those dim isles of rose and blue,
  For a palace far away,
Under the silvery willow-tree--
  So he said to Tenko;
And he painted, day by day,
  Golden visions of the sea.
No, he had not come to woo;
Yet, had Kimi proven true,
Doubtless he had loved her too,
  Hardly less than Tenko.

Since the thought was in his head,
He would make his choice and wed;
  And a lovely maid he chose
Under the silvery willow-tree.
  "Fairer far," said Tenko.
"Kimi had a twisted nose,
  And a foot too small, for me,
And her face was dull as lead!"
"Nay, a flower, be it white or red,
  Is a flower," Sawara said!
  "So it is," said Tenko.

Great Sawara, the painter,           [Sidenote: VII]
  Sought, on a day of days,
One of the peacock islands
  Out in the sunset haze:
Rose-red sails on the water
  Carried him quickly nigh:
There would he paint him a wonder,
  Worthy of Hokusai.

Lo, as he leapt o'er the creaming
  Roses of faery foam,
Out of the green-lipped caverns
  Under the isle's blue dome,
White as a drifting snow-flake,
  White as the moon's white flame,
White as a ghost from the darkness,
  Little O Kimi came.

"Long I have waited, Sawara,
  Here in our sunset isle,
Sawara, Sawara, Sawara,
  Look at me once, and smile:

Face I have watched so long for,
  Hands I have longed to hold,
Sawara, Sawara, Sawara,
  Why is your heart so cold?"

Surely, he thought, I have painted
  Nothing so fair as this
Moonlit almond blossom
  Sweet to fold and kiss....
"Kimi," he said, "I am wedded!
  Hush, for it could not be!"
"Kiss me one kiss," she whispered,
  "Me also, even me."

Small and terribly drifting
  Backward, her sad white face
Lifted up to Sawara
  Once, in that lonely place,
White as a drifting blossom
  Under his wondering eyes,
Slowly he gathered and held her
  Under the drifting skies.

                             [Illustration]

"Others are happy," she whispered,
  "Maidens and men I have seen:
Be happy, be happy, Sawara!
  The other--shall be--your queen!
Kiss me one kiss for parting":
  Trembling she lifted her head,
Then like a broken blossom
  It fell on his arm. She was dead.

Much impressed, Sawara straight     [Sidenote: VIII]
(Though the hour was growing late)
  Made a sketch of Kimi lying
By the lonely, sighing sea,
  Brought it back to Tenko.
Tenko looked it over crying
  (Under the silvery willow-tree).
"You have burst the golden gate!
You have conquered Time and Fate!
  Hokusai is not so great!
  This is art," said Tenko!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
